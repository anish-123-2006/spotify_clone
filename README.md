# spotify_clone
This is a frontend-only Spotify-inspired music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It loads and plays .mp3 songs from a static JSON file and works completely without any backend.
🎵 Dynamic song cards with play buttons

⏯️ Play, Pause, Next, Previous controls

📃 Timeline + volume slider

🎧 Displays current time and total time

📱 Responsive layout

🔁 JSON-based song management (no server required)

📂 Songs loaded from a local songs/ folder

All songs are listed in a static songs.json file.

The app fetches this file on load and creates song cards dynamically.

When a card is clicked, the song plays using the native HTML5 <audio> element.
Clone or download this repository.

Add your .mp3 songs in the /songs folder.

Update the songs.json file with your song details.
